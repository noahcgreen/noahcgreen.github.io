I love to break concepts down and rebuild them as functional tools. I've used machine learning
to train robots, published research on a novel neural network compression technique, worked
in iOS frontend development, built projects from the hardware up, and more. I'm drawn to
challenges which abstract complex theory into simple, useful, and meaningful technology.

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2021 as a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
Mathematics. My studies focused on artificial intelligence with applications in robotics,
linear algebra, and real analysis.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing classical music on piano, building electronics and software
projects, cooking, and making my [factory](https://www.factorio.com) grow.
