I'm a project person with a passion for all things technological. I love exploring the world of software, hardware,
and the human experience to identify creative and fulfilling projects. I've dabbled in a variety of disciplines
through my work, courses, and personal projects: robotics, ML/AI, mobile app development, and low-level computer
graphics, to name just a few.

I received my B.S. from Rutgers University in 2021 with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I pride myself on my ability to pick apart complex topics and uncover their core concepts; it bothers
me to interact with a system and not fully understand what's going on under its hood.

My favorite ways to spend my spare time are playing classical piano, cooking, and making my [factory](https://www.factorio.com) grow.
