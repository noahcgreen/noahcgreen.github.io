I'm here to build scalable, reproducible, and reliable software.

I love technical problems with technological solutions. Whether it's compiler theory, robotic
kinematics, scalable distributed databases, etc. — I love breaking these problems down and
engineering solutions which are as insightful as they are practical.

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
Mathematics. I spent a brief period of time as a Ph.D student, also at Rutgers, in the
[Algorithmic Robotics and Control](https://arc-l.github.io) lab. My studies focused on
linear algebra, real analysis, and artificial intelligence with applications in robotics.

Currently, I'm working at [Fiserv](https://www.fiserv.com) to bring a payment processing
platform handling millions of transactions per day to AWS. That involves building out our
cloud platform, migrating application-level code, and occasionally contributing to feature
development.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing classical piano, building electronics and software
projects, cooking, and making my [factory](https://www.factorio.com) grow. My current project
is [Crafty](https://github.com/noahcgreen/Crafty), an R7RS Scheme interpreter written in Haskell.
